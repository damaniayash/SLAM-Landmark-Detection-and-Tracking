    "To implement Graph SLAM, a matrix and a vector (omega and xi, respectively) are introduced. The matrix is square and labelled with all the robot poses (xi) and all the landmarks (Li). Every time you make an observation, for example, as you move between two poses by some distance `dx` and can relate those two positions, you can represent this as a numerical relationship in these matrices.\n",

One solution could be to create an omega and xi that are 2x larger that the number of robot poses (that will be generated over a series of time steps) and the number of landmarks, so that they can hold both x and y values for poses and landmark locations."
